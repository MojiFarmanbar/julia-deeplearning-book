The original book works with Python and PyTorch. This book works with Julia and relies primarily on [`Flux.jl`](https://fluxml.ai/) [@innes2018flux]. The original book is written by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugge [@howard2020deep]. This book is written by participants of the [Julia for Deep Learning](https://www.deep-learning.club/) course.
